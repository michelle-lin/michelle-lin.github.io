                    in elementary school, i used to spend so much time reading fiction books in my free time.
                    i remember i'd come home from school and just sit on the couch for hours reading lemony 
                    snicket's a series of unfortunate events or the percy jackson series. since then, i've really  
                    only done readings for my classes : ( . BUT this summer i set a goal for myself to read at 
                    least 5 books of my choice! so this is what i've got for y'all:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Turtles All the Way Down by John Green</li>
                        <li>Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan</li>
                        <li>Finding Chika: A Little Girl, an Earthquake, and the Making of a Family
                             by Mitch Albom</li>
                         <li>A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini</li>
                         <li>When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi</li>
                    </ul>

                    i'm going to be honest, i cried when at some point when reading each of these books (LOL). 
                    maybe i am very emotional and cry easily, but i also feel like when i read, i become very 
                    invested in the characters whether or not they are ficitonal and all of these authors have 
                    done such an amazing job in crafting their stories.

                    i've been playing basketball since 5th grade and i would honestly say that it played 
                    the largest role in my character development. there's so much to learn from the game 
                    and it's a great way to meet new people : ) i don't play nearly as much as i used to
